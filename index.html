      <li><strong> Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin Jr. KBE</strong><em>(16 April 1889 – 25 December 1977)</em>  was an English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the era of silent film.</li>
      <li> He became a worldwide icon through his screen persona, the Tramp, and is considered one of the film industry's most important figures.</li>
      <li> His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy.</li>
      <li> Chaplin's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship. His father was absent and his mother struggled financially - he was sent to a workhouse twice before age nine.</li>
      <li> When he was 14, his mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian. </li>
      <li> At 19, he was signed to the Fred Karno company, which took him to America.</li>
      <li> Chaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for most of his films.</li>
      <li> He was a perfectionist, and his financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development and production of a picture. </li>
      <li> His films are characterised by slapstick combined with pathos, typified in the Tramp's struggles against adversity. </li>
      <li> He received an Honorary Academy Award for "the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century" in 1972, as part of a renewed appreciation for his work.</li>
      <li> He continues to be held in high regard, with The Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times, and The Great Dictator often ranked on lists of the greatest films.</li>
